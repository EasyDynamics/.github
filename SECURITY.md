# Reporting Security Issues

Security vulnerabilities should be reported directly via email to
opensource-security@easydynamics.com. Please **do not** use GitHub issues to report security issues.
A member of the Easy Dynamics team will review your report and respond.

To help out team review your report, please provide as much information as possible in your initial
report, such as the type of issue, the file(s) and branch(es) where the issue is known to be
present, and steps that can be taken to reproduce the issue. Specific proofs of concept and patches
are welcome as well.
